# NumberNinjaTees Master Architecture

## Mission

NumberNinjaTees is a dark tactical premium brand for data, Excel and
programming audiences. This repository currently serves the publicly reachable
static host required for website identity, integration privacy disclosure and
social-platform verification/OAuth redirect endpoints.

The architecture must support gradual expansion into SEO-focused content and
social media automation without exposing credentials in a public static site.

## Current Production Baseline

The checked-in runtime is intentionally small:

| Capability | Implementation | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root presence | `index.html` | Premium business landing page for the apparel brand and official Etsy channel |
| Privacy disclosure | `privacy.html` | Public policy tied to NumberNinjaTees and Pinterest Marketing OS |
| Terms and contact | `terms.html`, `contact.html` | Business identity, Etsy sales boundary and reviewer contact |
| Pinterest review | `pinterest-api.html` | Public API purpose, safeguards, scopes and submission-ready text |
| Pinterest redirect | `pinterest/callback/index.html` | Public callback landing page; it never exposes or exchanges tokens |
| TikTok redirect path | `tiktok/callback/index.html` | Public callback location; it does not exchange OAuth codes |
| TikTok ownership proof | Root verification text files | Filenames are externally referenced contracts |

There is no client application runtime, protected API layer, job runner,
database, authentication service or secrets store in this public repository.
The Pinterest review pages make that boundary explicit rather than implying a
static site performs authenticated automation.

## Architecture Boundaries

```text
Public GitHub Pages host
|
|-- Static public pages and metadata
|-- Public verification files
|-- Public OAuth redirect user experience
|
`-- Never contains server-side token exchange, secrets or private analytics data

Secure external automation service (future separate deployable)
|
|-- OAuth code exchange and encrypted token storage
|-- Rate-limited API integrations and retries
|-- Scheduling, content pipelines and audit logs
`-- Analytics ingestion and reporting
```

A static GitHub Pages repository cannot safely execute authenticated publishing
automation. Any API feature requiring a secret or a durable token belongs in a
secure service, not browser JavaScript or `localStorage`.

## Modular Repository Layout

| Path | Ownership and allowed contents |
| --- | --- |
| `core/` | Shared frontend configuration, logging facade, status modelling and storage adapters when a browser runtime is introduced |
| `modules/` | Isolated public-site or dashboard capabilities, each with a documented user outcome |
| `api/` | Browser-safe API interfaces only; secure provider clients must live in a private service repository or protected deployment |
| `automation/` | Architecture and non-secret automation assets; no production credentials or token exports |
| `assets/` | Optimized fonts, images, icons and styles used by public pages |
| `docs/` | Runbooks, provider setup decisions and release procedures |
| `archive/` | Retired assets with documented retirement reason; never loaded by production pages |

## Integration Architecture

For TikTok, Pinterest, Etsy or later platform integrations:

1. Public pages provide platform-verifiable URLs and user-facing policies.
2. An OAuth redirect may land on this domain for user status display only.
3. Authorization codes and tokens must be handled by a secure server endpoint.
4. The server must implement expiry handling, encrypted token storage, scoped
   access, bounded retries, rate-limit backoff, audit logging and revocation.
5. The UI exposes connection health with consistent states: connected (green),
   reconnecting (orange), and error (red).

The registered Pinterest redirect candidate published by this repository is:

```text
https://baswit7.github.io/numberninjatees.github.io/pinterest/callback/
```

Pinterest requires an OAuth redirect URI to match the registered value exactly.
A public static landing page alone is not evidence of token exchange or API
execution; Standard access review must demonstrate the protected OAuth/API
flow separately.

## UX And Design Rules

- Mobile-first responsive interface with fast first render.
- Brand palette: background `#070707`, surface `#0F0F0F`, accent `#00FF94`,
  text `#EDEBE3`, muted `#777777`.
- Brand typography preference: Orbitron, JetBrains Mono and Bebas Neue,
  loaded with performance-conscious fallbacks or self-hosted optimized assets.
- Accessibility is mandatory: semantic HTML, keyboard interaction, visible
  focus states, sufficient contrast and reduced-motion support.
- Public integration and privacy pages prioritize clarity and trust above
  decorative motion.

## SEO And Public Metadata

Public marketing pages should include canonical URL policy, metadata, Open
Graph/social previews, structured data where factually justified, sitemap and
robots policy. OAuth callbacks and technical verification resources should not
be treated as acquisition landing pages.

## Performance Strategy

- Preserve static deployment for publicly cacheable pages where possible.
- Keep critical HTML/CSS small and avoid heavy client frameworks without a
  demonstrated application need.
- Optimize and dimension assets before publishing.
- Add automated HTML/link checks and performance budgets before the public site
  grows beyond the current small surface.
- Isolate automation processing from public page delivery.

## Scalability Strategy

- Introduce functionality as independently owned modules, not one expanding
  HTML file.
- Maintain stable public integration endpoints while services evolve behind
  them.
- Deploy private automation separately with explicit provider adapters and an
  auditable job model.
- Version provider contract changes and record operational decisions in docs.

## Primary Risks

| Risk | Impact | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secrets added to a public Pages repository | Credential compromise | Never store credentials here; use a protected service and secret store |
| Static callback mistaken for full OAuth backend | Broken or insecure integration | Define server-side flow before enabling authenticated automation |
| Provider verification paths removed casually | Platform disconnection | Treat filenames/routes as compatibility contracts |
| Marketing scope added without performance controls | Slow, weak-converting site | Introduce budgets, optimized assets and scoped modules |
| Policy text does not match data processing | Compliance/platform approval failure | Review privacy terms against each enabled integration before launch |

## Architectural Decision Baseline

The repository remains a static public host until a concrete product feature
requires application runtime. Authenticated automation will be designed as a
separate secure deployable; it will not be embedded in the GitHub Pages
frontend.
