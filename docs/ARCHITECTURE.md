# Architecture

## Current Repository Role

This repository hosts static NumberNinjaTees verification pages and Studio OS governance documentation.

## Phase 9 Addition

Phase 9 introduces a non-executing Execution Governance Layer:

- `services/execution-governance/`
- `shared/contracts/execution/`
- `runtime/execution/`
- `scripts/validation/`
- `scripts/health/`

The layer evaluates future action readiness through contracts and validation scripts only. It does not include execution dispatch, provider integrations, deployment automation, queues, schedulers, or background workers.

## Phase 10 Addition

Phase 10 introduces a non-executing Execution Readiness Layer:

- `services/execution-readiness/`
- `shared/contracts/readiness/`
- `runtime/readiness/`
- readiness validation scripts under `scripts/validation/`

The layer validates future execution plans, steps, dependency checks, preflight checks, approval-chain completeness, rollback coverage, idempotency coverage, and readiness decisions before any execution plane exists. A readiness decision does not grant execution permission and does not bypass Phase 9 governance.

## Phase 12 Design Addition

Phase 12 introduces dashboard/runtime boundary design documentation only:

- `docs/governance/DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md`
- `docs/governance/PHASE_12_DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md`
- `docs/governance/PHASE_READINESS_MATRIX.md`

The design separates read-only dashboard projection from composite refresh orchestration. It defines future no-write validation mode, prohibits dashboard-driven runtime mutation, and keeps validator and business-rule ownership outside dashboard code. Phase 12 does not add dashboard UI, execution dispatch, provider integrations, deployment automation, queues, schedulers, executors, agents, workers, or background runners.
