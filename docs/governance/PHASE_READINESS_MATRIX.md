# Phase Readiness Matrix

## Matrix

| Phase | Layer | Status | Runtime Capability | Dashboard Capability | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | Coordination audit | Documented audit only | None | None | Declarative planning only |
| 9 | Execution governance | Implemented as non-executing governance | None | None | Governance records are evidence only |
| 10 | Execution readiness | Implemented as non-executing readiness | None | None | Readiness is future-review evidence only |
| 11 | Reserved | Not present in this checkout | None | None | No local evidence available |
| 12 | Dashboard/runtime boundary design | Designed only | None | No UI implementation | Read-only projection boundary only |
| 13 | Projection contract and no-write validator interface | Implemented as contracts only | None | Passive read-only consumption only | Runtime truth, adapter-produced projections, no-write structural validation |
| 14 | Projection fixture validation and stale-projection detection | Implemented as read-only fixtures only | None | Passive read-only consumption only | Static fixture validation, timestamp-only stale detection |

## Phase 12 Readiness Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboard projection separated from composite refresh | Ready for future design review | `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md` |
| No-write validation mode defined | Ready for future design review | `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md` |
| Dashboard/runtime mutation boundary documented | Ready for future design review | `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md` |
| Dashboard validator duplication prohibited | Ready for future design review | `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md` |
| Execution-readiness visibility labels constrained | Ready for future design review | `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md` |
| Runtime capability introduced | Not allowed | Phase 12 non-goals |
| Dashboard UI introduced | Not allowed | Phase 12 non-goals |

## Advancement Gate

Phase 13 or a later implementation phase may start only after validation confirms:

- Phase 12 remains documentation/design only.
- No runtime execution capability was added.
- No dashboard UI writes or refresh orchestration were added.
- No validator or business rule was duplicated into dashboard code.

## Phase 13 Readiness Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Projection contracts documented | Complete | `PROJECTION_CONTRACT.md` |
| Machine-readable projection contract present | Complete | `shared/contracts/projections/dashboard-projection.schema.json` |
| No-write validator interface present | Complete | `shared/contracts/projections/no-write-validator.interface.schema.json` |
| Adapter-only producer boundary present | Complete | `services/dashboard-adapter/README.md` |
| Projection contract validator present | Complete | `scripts/validation/validate-projection-contracts.ps1` |
| Runtime truth remains authoritative | Enforced | `projection-contract.manifest.json` |
| Dashboard remains passive visual consumer | Enforced | `projection-contract.manifest.json` |
| Projection layer write capability | Not allowed | Phase 13 non-goals |
| Runtime capability introduced | Not allowed | Phase 13 non-goals |

## Phase 14 Advancement Gate

Phase 14 may add read-only projection builder fixtures only after validation confirms:

- Projection contracts remain strict schemas.
- Dashboard code still has no write, refresh, execution, provider, deployment, queue, worker, scheduler, agent, storage, secret, or credential capability.
- Runtime evidence remains the source of truth.
- Adapter-generated projection JSON remains derived and non-authoritative.

## Phase 14 Readiness Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh projection fixture present | Complete | `shared/contracts/projections/fixtures/fresh-dashboard.projection.json` |
| Stale projection fixture present | Complete | `shared/contracts/projections/fixtures/stale-dashboard.projection.json` |
| Fixture authority remains runtime-owned | Enforced | `scripts/validation/validate-projection-contracts.ps1` |
| Fixture boundary flags remain disabled | Enforced | `scripts/validation/validate-projection-contracts.ps1` |
| Stale projection detection present | Enforced | `scripts/validation/validate-projection-contracts.ps1` |
| Projection fixtures contain execution capability | Not allowed | Phase 14 non-goals |
| Runtime capability introduced | Not allowed | Phase 14 non-goals |

## Phase 15 Advancement Gate

Phase 15 may add read-only adapter contract harnessing only after validation confirms:

- Phase 14 fixtures remain static committed evidence.
- Stale detection remains timestamp-only and local.
- No dashboard write, runtime mutation, execution, provider, deployment, credential, browser-storage, queue, worker, scheduler, or background-runner authority was added.
