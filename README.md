## Studio OS Phase 9

This repository now includes a non-executing Execution Governance Layer for Studio OS Phase 9. It models approval, risk, rollback readiness, idempotency, and execution policy without adding provider calls, deployments, workers, queues, schedulers, or secret access.

## Studio OS Phase 10

Phase 10 adds a non-executing Execution Readiness Layer on top of Phase 9. It models future execution plans, steps, dependency checks, preflight checks, approval-chain completeness, rollback coverage, idempotency coverage, and readiness decisions. It does not execute workflows, agents, providers, deployments, queues, schedulers, workers, or external mutations.

## Studio OS Phase 12

Phase 12 adds dashboard/runtime boundary design only. It separates future read-only dashboard projection from composite refresh orchestration, defines no-write validation mode, and keeps validator and business logic out of dashboard code. It does not add dashboard UI or runtime capability.
