## Studio OS Phase 9

This repository now includes a non-executing Execution Governance Layer for Studio OS Phase 9. It models approval, risk, rollback readiness, idempotency, and execution policy without adding provider calls, deployments, workers, queues, schedulers, or secret access.

## Studio OS Phase 10

Phase 10 adds a non-executing Execution Readiness Layer on top of Phase 9. It models future execution plans, steps, dependency checks, preflight checks, approval-chain completeness, rollback coverage, idempotency coverage, and readiness decisions. It does not execute workflows, agents, providers, deployments, queues, schedulers, workers, or external mutations.

## Studio OS Phase 12

Phase 12 adds dashboard/runtime boundary design only. It separates future read-only dashboard projection from composite refresh orchestration, defines no-write validation mode, and keeps validator and business logic out of dashboard code. It does not add dashboard UI or runtime capability.

## Studio OS Phase 13

Phase 13 adds the Projection Contract and No-Write Validator Interface layer. It defines read-only dashboard projection schemas, adapter producer ownership, passive dashboard consumption, and structural no-write validation. It does not add dashboard writes, runtime mutation, provider calls, deployment calls, executors, workers, queues, schedulers, agents, browser storage, secrets, or credential handling.

## Studio OS Phase 14

Phase 14 adds read-only projection fixtures and stale-projection detection. It validates fresh and stale projection examples through local JSON inspection only. It does not add execution, provider calls, deployment calls, dashboard writes, runtime mutation, schedulers, workers, queues, credentials, browser storage, or UI command execution.
